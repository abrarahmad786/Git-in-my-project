            1. Whiter, healthier teeth
        </strong>: Apple won’t replace your toothbrush, but biting and chewing an
        apple stimulates the<br> production of
        saliva in your mouth, reducing tooth decay by lowering the levels of bacteria.

        <strong>2. Avoid Alzheimer’s</strong>: A study on the benefits of apples shows that drinking apple juice could
        keep
        <br>: Alzheimer’s away and fight the effects of aging on the brain. The mice in the study<br>
        that were fed an apple-enhanced diet showed higher levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and did better
        in maze tests than those on a regular diet.

        <strong> 3. Protect against Parkinson’s</strong><br>:
        Research has shown that people who eat fruits and other high-fibre foods (ahem, apples)
        may be protected against Parkinson’s disease, a condition characterized by a<br>
        breakdown of the brain’s dopamine-producing nerve cells.

        <strong> 4. Curb all sorts of cancers</strong>
        Scientists from the American Association for Cancer Research, among others, agree that<br>
        the consumption of flavonol-rich apples could help reduce <br>
        your risk of developing pancreatic cancer by up to 23 percent.

        <strong> 5. Decrease your risk of diabetes</strong>
        Women who eat apples — at least one a day — are 28 percent less likely <br>
        to develop type 2 diabetes than those who don’t eat apples.<br>
        The reason this is a health benefit of apples is because this fruit is loaded<br>
        with soluble fibre, the key to blunting blood sugar swings.

    <div tyle="width: 50; height: 100; background-color: dodgerblue;margin: 0px;">
        <strong> 6. Reduce cholesterol</strong>
        The soluble fibre found in apples binds with fats in the intestine,
        which translates into lower cholesterol levels and a healthier you.
